# 🎯 Interactive Review Mode - Complete Guide

## Overview

The Interactive Review Mode is a powerful feature that presents threads requiring your attention and allows you to take action directly from the console. It creates actual email drafts in Outlook, flags threads for follow-up, and provides intelligent action suggestions.

## ✨ Features

### 1. **Intelligent Thread Filtering**
- Automatically identifies threads requiring attention based on:
  - Priority score (≥40 = Medium or higher)
  - Response needed flag
  - Urgent indicators
- Sorts threads by priority (highest first)

### 2. **Comprehensive Thread Presentation**
For each thread, you see:
- **Thread name** and priority score
- **Email count** and participant count
- **Duration** in days
- **Flags**: URGENT, DELAY, TRANSPORT, CUSTOMS
- **Executive summary** excerpt
- **Suggested actions** based on analysis

### 3. **Action Options**
For each thread, you can:
1. **Create draft reply** - Generates email draft in Outlook with:
   - Pre-filled subject (Re: thread name)
   - Reply template from AI analysis
   - Correct recipients (from last email)
   - CC list preserved
2. **Mark for follow-up** - Flags all emails in thread
3. **View full summary** - Shows complete analysis
4. **Skip thread** - Move to next
5. **Exit** - Stop review session

### 4. **Draft Management**
- Drafts are saved in Outlook Drafts folder
- After review, offers to open all created drafts
- Drafts can be reviewed and sent from Outlook

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Priority Calculation
Threads are scored 0-100 based on:
- **Urgency keywords** (+30 points)
- **Response needed** (+25 points)
- **Recent activity** (+20 if < 2 days)
- **Multiple participants** (+10 if > 3)
- **Delay indicators** (+15 points)
- **High email volume** (+10 if > 10 emails)
- **Customs/Transport flags** (+5 each)

### Draft Creation Process
1. Creates new MailItem in Outlook
2. Sets subject: `Re: [thread name]`
3. Finds thread folder in Outlook
4. Gets last email from thread
5. Copies recipient and CC from last email
6. Inserts AI-generated reply template
7. Saves draft (does not send)

### Follow-Up Flagging
1. Finds thread folder in Outlook
2. Iterates through all emails
3. Sets flag: "Follow up"
4. Sets status: Marked
5. Saves each email

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Cached Mode**
- After initial processing, use `cached` mode
- Saves time by reusing existing summaries
- Perfect for daily reviews

### 2. **Review in Batches**
- Process top 5-10 threads per session
- Use `0` to exit and continue later
- Prevents review fatigue

### 3. **Customize Reply Templates**
- Templates are AI-generated but editable
- Review in Outlook before sending
- Add personal touches

### 4. **Use Follow-Up Flags**
- For threads not needing immediate response
- Creates visual reminder in Outlook
- Can filter by flag later

### 5. **Regular Regeneration**
- Run `existing` mode weekly
- Updates priorities based on new activity
- Catches threads that became urgent

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No threads requiring attention
**Solution**: Lower the priority threshold or check if threads are archived

### Issue: Draft creation fails
**Solution**: 
- Ensure Outlook is running
- Check thread folder exists in Outlook
- Verify permissions

### Issue: Recipients not populated
**Solution**: 
- Thread folder must exist in Outlook
- Last email must have sender information
- Manually add recipients in Outlook

### Issue: Unicode errors in console
**Solution**: 
- Use test script instead of interactive mode
- Or remove emojis from display
