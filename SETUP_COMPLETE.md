# ✅ Setup Complete!

## What's Installed

✅ **All dependencies installed successfully:**
- pywin32 (Outlook automation)
- pandas & matplotlib (data & visualization)
- plotly (interactive charts)
- transformers & torch (HuggingFace AI)
- sentencepiece (text processing)
- All supporting libraries

✅ **Using HuggingFace (Local AI)**
- No API key needed
- No ongoing costs
- Runs entirely on your machine
- First run will download model (~500MB), then cached

## How to Run

### Option 1: Double-click `RUN_ME.bat`

### Option 2: Command line
```powershell
python main.py
```

## First Run

**Choose Option 2** (Scan Only) to preview threads without moving emails.

The system will:
1. Connect to Outlook
2. Scan your inbox for threads (3+ emails)
3. Show you what it found
4. **NOT move any emails** (preview mode)

Then run **Option 1** to actually organize threads.

## What Happens

### First Time AI Summary
- Downloads HuggingFace model (~500MB)
- Takes 2-3 minutes
- Cached for future use (instant after that)

### Processing
1. **Identifies threads** using Outlook's ConversationID
2. **Creates "Threads" folder** in your Inbox
3. **Moves emails** to organized subfolders
4. **Generates AI summaries** for each thread
5. **Creates timelines** (visual charts)
6. **Exports to Excel** (all threads in spreadsheet)

## Output Location

## In Outlook

```

    ├── 2024-01-20_Customs_Issue_xyz789/
    └── ...
```

## Customization

Edit `config.py`:

```python
THREAD_MIN_EMAILS = 3           # Lower to 2 for shorter threads
USE_AI_SUMMARIZATION = True     # Set False for rule-based only
KEYWORDS_TRANSPORT = [...]      # Add your company terms
```

## Tips

1. **Start with Option 2** (preview) to see what will happen
2. **First AI summary** takes time (downloading model)
3. **Subsequent runs** are fast (model cached)
4. **Check Excel file** for overview of all threads
5. **Read individual summaries** for details

## Troubleshooting

**"No threads found"**
→ Lower `THREAD_MIN_EMAILS` to 2 in config.py

**"Outlook error"**
→ Make sure Outlook desktop app is open and logged in

**AI model download slow**
→ Normal on first run, be patient (2-3 min)

**Want rule-based only**
→ Set `USE_AI_SUMMARIZATION = False` in config.py

## What's Different from OpenAI Version

✅ **No API key needed**
✅ **No ongoing costs**
✅ **Works offline** (after first download)
✅ **Privacy** - data stays on your machine
✅ **Faster** after first run (no API calls)

⚠️ **First run slower** (model download)
⚠️ **Summaries slightly different** (but still very good!)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `RUN_ME.bat` or `python main.py`
2. ✅ Choose Option 2 (preview)
3. ✅ Review what threads it finds
4. ✅ Run Option 1 to organize
5. ✅ Check `output/thread_summary.xlsx`
6. ✅ Read individual thread summaries
7. ✅ Enjoy organized emails! 🎉
