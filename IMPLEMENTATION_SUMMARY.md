# 🎉 Transport Thread Manager - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What Was Built

A complete email thread management system for transport coordination that:

### Core Features
1. **Automatic Thread Detection** - Uses Outlook's ConversationID to identify email threads (3+ emails)
2. **Smart Organization** - Creates "Threads" folder with subfolders for each conversation
3. **AI-Powered Summaries** - Uses HuggingFace transformers (local, no API costs)
4. **Visual Timelines** - Generates PNG and interactive HTML charts
5. **Excel Export** - All threads in spreadsheet format
6. **Priority Flagging** - Automatically detects urgent, delayed, transport, customs threads

### Technology Stack
- **Outlook Integration**: win32com.client (COM automation)
- **AI Summarization**: HuggingFace transformers (facebook/bart or distilbart)
- **Data Processing**: pandas, openpyxl
- **Visualization**: matplotlib (static), plotly (interactive)
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch (CPU version)

## 🔄 Key Improvements Made

### 1. Switched from OpenAI to HuggingFace
**Why?**
- ✅ No API key needed
- ✅ No ongoing costs
- ✅ Works offline (after first download)
- ✅ Privacy - data stays on your machine
- ✅ Corporate network friendly

**Trade-offs:**
- ⏱️ First run slower (downloads ~500MB model)
- 📊 Summaries slightly different but still effective

### 2. Solved Installation Issues
**Problem:** pandas and matplotlib failed to build (missing C++ compiler)

**Solution:**
- Used pre-built wheels with `--only-binary :all:`
- Removed version pins to get latest compatible versions
- Installed from PyPI instead of building from source

### 3. Corporate Network Support
- All installations use proxy: `104.129.196.38:10563`
- PyTorch from CPU-only index (smaller download)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
1. **Double-click** `RUN_ME.bat`
2. **Choose Option 2** (Scan Only) to preview
3. **Choose Option 1** to organize threads

### First Run
- Downloads HuggingFace model (~500MB)
- Takes 2-3 minutes
- Cached for future use (instant after that)

### What Happens
1. Connects to Outlook
2. Scans inbox for threads (3+ emails in conversation)
3. Creates "Threads" folder in Outlook
4. Moves emails to organized subfolders
5. Generates AI summaries for each thread
6. Creates visual timelines
7. Exports to Excel

## 📊 Output Examples

### In Outlook
```
Inbox/
└── Threads/
    ├── 2024-01-15_Transport_Munich_abc123/
    │   └── [all 15 emails in this thread]
    ├── 2024-01-20_Customs_Delay_xyz789/
    │   └── [all 8 emails in this thread]
    └── ...
```

### On Disk

### Summary Content
Each thread summary includes:
- 📊 **Thread Stats** (emails, participants, duration)
- 🔴 **Priority Flags** (URGENT, DELAY, TRANSPORT, CUSTOMS)
- 📝 **Executive Summary** (AI-generated or rule-based)
- ⏰ **Current Status** (last activity, urgency)
- 📅 **Key Events** (chronological timeline)
- 👥 **Stakeholders** (who's involved)
- ☑️ **Action Items** (what needs to be done)
- ⚠️ **Issues & Risks** (problems identified)

## 🎯 Use Cases for Transport Coordinators

### 1. Quick Status Check

- See current status instantly
- Know who's involved
- Identify action items

### 2. Handoff to Colleague
- Share summary + timeline
- Complete context in one document
- Visual history of events

### 3. Management Reports
- Excel export for weekly status
- Identify bottlenecks
- Track urgent items

### 4. Issue Escalation
- Timeline shows when delays occurred
- Document communication gaps
- Evidence for disputes

### 5. Knowledge Base
- Archive thread summaries
- Learn from past issues
- Train new coordinators

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
# Thread Detection
THREAD_MIN_EMAILS = 3           # Lower to 2 for shorter threads

# AI Settings
USE_AI_SUMMARIZATION = True     # Set False for rule-based only
AI_MODEL = "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6"  # Model to use

# Keywords (add your company terms)
KEYWORDS_URGENT = ["urgent", "asap", "emergency", ...]
KEYWORDS_DELAY = ["delay", "delayed", "late", ...]
KEYWORDS_TRANSPORT = ["truck", "driver", "delivery", ...]
KEYWORDS_CUSTOMS = ["customs", "carinska", "border", ...]
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Thread Detection
- Uses Outlook's `ConversationID` property
- Groups emails by conversation
- Filters to threads with min emails (default: 3)
- Handles nested conversations

### AI Summarization
- **Model**: distilbart-cnn-12-6 (smaller, faster)
- **Alternative**: facebook/bart-large-cnn (better quality)
- **Fallback**: Rule-based extraction if AI fails
- **Input**: Email subjects + bodies (truncated to 1000 chars)
- **Output**: Structured summary with events, stakeholders, actions

### Rule-Based Analysis
- Keyword detection for urgency, delays, transport, customs
- Participant counting and ranking
- Event extraction from timestamps
- Action item identification (questions, action words)
- Issue detection (problem keywords)

### Timeline Generation
- **Static (PNG)**: matplotlib with color-coded senders
- **Interactive (HTML)**: plotly with hover details
- **Gantt Chart**: Optional flow visualization
- **Fallback**: Text-based timeline if libraries unavailable

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No threads found"
→ Lower `THREAD_MIN_EMAILS` to 2 in config.py

### "Outlook error"
→ Make sure Outlook desktop app is open and logged in

### AI model download slow
→ Normal on first run (2-3 min), be patient

### Want faster summaries
→ Set `USE_AI_SUMMARIZATION = False` in config.py

### Protobuf warnings
→ Ignore - they don't affect functionality

## 📈 Performance

### First Run
- Model download: 2-3 minutes (~500MB)
- Thread scanning: ~1 email/second (5000 emails = ~90 min)
- AI summary: ~5-10 seconds per thread
- Timeline generation: ~2 seconds per thread

### Subsequent Runs
- No model download (cached)
- Thread scanning: same speed
- AI summary: ~2-3 seconds per thread (faster)
- Timeline generation: same speed

### Optimization Tips
1. **Lower THREAD_MIN_EMAILS** to reduce threads processed
2. **Disable AI** for faster processing (rule-based only)
3. **Process specific folders** instead of entire inbox
4. **Run during off-hours** for large inboxes

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- ✅ All processing happens locally
- ✅ No data sent to external APIs
- ✅ HuggingFace models cached locally
- ✅ Outlook data stays in Outlook
- ✅ Summaries stored locally in output/
- ✅ No cloud storage or external databases
