# 🎯 Improvements Summary

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. **Fixed Fallback Summary Issue** 
**Problem**: Summaries showing "fallback method" instead of proper analysis  
**Solution**: 
- Added `conversation_insights` to fallback summary
- Even when rule-based fails, basic insights are still extracted
- Better error handling with full stack traces

**Impact**: No more missing insights in summaries

---

### 2. **Enhanced Error Logging**
**Problem**: Hard to debug when summarization fails  
**Solution**:
- Added `exc_info=True` to log full stack traces
- Log thread name and email count on errors
- Better visibility into what's failing and why

**Impact**: Easier troubleshooting and debugging

- **+10 points**: High email volume (> 10)
- **+5 points**: Customs-related
- **+5 points**: Transport-related

- **Critical**: 70-100 points 🔴
- **High**: 50-69 points 🟠
- **Medium**: 30-49 points 🟡
- **Low**: 0-29 points 🟢
